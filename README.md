# swaggerTry
Swagger trial with simple database schema of my project.
To run the project, go to your commmand line, and enter the folder. Then run the command:
"swagger project start"
'project-name' is the name of the folder. Like 'newproject' in this case.
With this, there will be nothing on the screen, an error message will be displayed on screen.
For an editor with some ui with the YAML file, we need to write 
"swagger project edit"
It will automatically open a browser with a editor in the left and UI in the right in which the changes which we make here, will be changed in the swagger file in the folder of the project.
File destination is: Project-folder/api/swagger/swagger.yaml
